This is a work in progress - I am implementing a simple part of speech tagger in multiple neural network frameworks as a way to learn them.

Example generation:
```
./visualise.py tagger.dy.py tagger.pt.py tagger.tf.py > docs/index.html
```

Todo:
- Add Disqus
- Add saving and loading models
- Work out recurrent dropout in pytorch
- Work out weight decay in tensorflow
- Check results still match / code has not been broken
